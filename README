This git repo provides a simple command line tool for accessing the wordreference.com dictionairy page.

In addition a very simple bash script has been written to print a word and definition at random - from the definitions you have looked up - at the top of the bash terminal each time it opens.

In order to run the script I have done the following:

The files are in the directory ~/Documents/Terminal/wordOfTerminal - you may need to edit the directory in each of the files as desired.

I have added the following lines to ~/.bash_aliases - of course add the languages you want:

alias ca='~/Documents/Terminal/wordOfTerminal/wordofTerminal.py ca'
alias it='~/Documents/Terminal/wordOfTerminal/wordofTerminal.py it'

Then add the following to the bottom of ~/.bashrc :

bash ~/Documents/Terminal/wordOfTerminal/wordOfTerminal.sh

Finally, run it WORD or ca WORD yourlanguage WORD etc ..
